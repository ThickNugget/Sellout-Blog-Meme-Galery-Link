        <h2>This is how to give me money</h2>
        <p> Ok so the way that you give me money is you could watch an advertisement on my ad fly website and I get $0.002 per view</p>
        <p> Another way that you could give me money is to buy me random stuff on This minecraft server's website. </p>
        <p> My minecraft username so you can buy me stuff if: Thick_Nugget_14</p>
        <p> The link to the store is: store.hypixel.net</p>
        <p> If ur gonna buy me stuff on that website pls give me skyblock gems or a rank. I already have VIP+ so if you want to get me a rank you should get MVP, MVP+, or MVP++</p> 
    
        <p> But if you want me to get money, but you don't want to lose money, watch ads on my ad fly page. Thanks for making me not porrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</p>
